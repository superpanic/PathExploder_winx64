# Plug-in for Adobe Illustrator
This is a plug-in for the Windows version of Adobe Illustrator, written in C++ using the Adobe Illustrator SDK 2021. 

The macOS version is found here.

When the plug-in is installed in Adobe Illustrator the Path Exploder tool is added to the tool palette.

Use the Path Exploder tool to separate the currently selected path objects temporarily. 

Sometimes you end up with a lot of paths on top of each other and want to delete or edit say the path hidden down under two paths. To get access to the path you want to edit, select all the paths that are stacked and use the Path Exploder tool to drag-separate the selected paths. Then delete or edit the paths you want to edit. Select the Path Exploder tool again and just single click to put the paths back where they were before.
